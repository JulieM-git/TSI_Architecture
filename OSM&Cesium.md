OSM is massive data sets. NYC had imported all of it's data into OSM.
Extract from Mapzen and turned it into 3D Tiles.

Visualize OSM metadata.

Manipulate the height : select color, slider hidding buildings below a certain height.

OSM data available for download, but there is lot of dataset. We can use sites for extracts. 

An OSM pbf reader that will give you JSON  representations of nodes, ways, and relations from OSM, osm-pbf-parser

JSON format contains : 
- type, 
- id, 
- tags, 
- members, 
- info..

Generate collada files
glTF and 3D Tiles

Problems with OSM data : lot of building parts don't actually refer back to  their parent relation like they are supposed to

Take CityGML or KML datasets and turn them into 3D Tiles as well ?

Only a very small percentage of OSM data actually has 3D building metadata.
