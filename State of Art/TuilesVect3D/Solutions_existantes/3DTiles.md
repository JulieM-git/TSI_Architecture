<p style="text-align:justify;">3D Tiles are an [open specification](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles) for streaming massive heterogeneous 3D geospatial datasets. To expand on Cesiumâ€™s terrain and imagery streaming, 3D Tiles will be used to stream 3D content, including buildings, trees, point clouds, and vector data.
<br/>
Bringing techniques from graphics research, the movie industry, and the game industry to 3D geospatial, 3D Tiles define a spatial data structure and a set of tile formats designed for 3D and optimized for streaming and rendering. Tiles for 3D models use [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf), the WebGL runtime asset format developed by Khronos, which the Cesium team heavily contributes to.</p>
