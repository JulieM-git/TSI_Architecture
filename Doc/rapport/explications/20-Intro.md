# Introduction  
2D mapping is omnipresent in our lives. For several years, 3D has been developed in research laboratories and the technology is ready. New application have emerged, especially with augmented and virtual reality. Indeed, the 3D facilitates the immersion in the space and it is important for many fields: urbanism, transport ...

We wish to bring a new dimension to cartography and geographic information by using existing databases containing architectural objects such as geolocalized buildings.

We have available IGN data that lists information on buildings on a national scale.

Originally developed for research at the IGN, Itowns is a digital globe that allows to view 3D data. The project has now moved into the Open Source world. Oslandia, an open source GIS solution company, is contributing to this project. This tool remains in development and improvement. It is destined to become the 3D visualization tool of the GeoPortail.
Therefore, this transition requires a reflection on the data to be used as well as a modeling of the processes to be used. The interest of the 3D component within the geoportal is to allow, on the one hand, a user to have access to three-dimensional information and, on the other hand, to exploit a phenomenal quantity of this type of data.

Our work was to carry out a state of the art on the environment of 3D vector tiles to develop a production chain, from the creation of the tiles, from the data of the IGN, to their availability, in order to develop new services.
