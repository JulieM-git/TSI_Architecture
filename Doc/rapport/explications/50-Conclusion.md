# Conclusion

This work has allowed us touching everything from database (Postgis, BVH) until the visualization (Cesium) passing by the file transfer (3DTiles).

In addition, this project gave us the opportunity to meet professionals (Oslandia, ITowns via IGN). We were able to establish links in a professional way while adding our added value.
