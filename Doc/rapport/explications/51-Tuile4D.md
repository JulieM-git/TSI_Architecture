# Perspective: 4D Tile

In 3D, we master space with height, width and depth. But if we want to touch the 4D, we need to add a time component.We must pass into an imaginary referential of space-time. In physics, we must think about the evolution of matter and object as a function of time or duration. We do not have actually a efficient management of time on object.
